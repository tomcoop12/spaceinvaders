Tom Cooper - Interactive Media Project -Pokevaders

This is my reverse engineered version of cykods original ALien Invaders game. 

A Space Invaders like game - I based my new game on Pokemon; the player controls Pikachu and must shoot pokeballs
at the enemy Pokemon Charmander, Squirtle and Bulbasaur whilst trying to dodge their
own attacks.
